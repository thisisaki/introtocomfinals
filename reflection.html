        <div class="text2">➤ </div>
        <div class="text3">Before the quarantine, I really did not have a deep trust in God. There were even times
            when I questioned His existence and struggled to believe in Him. I often felt lost or unsure about my faith,
            and it seemed difficult to feel connected to something greater than myself. However, when the quarantine
            began and technology started emerging and spreading faster than ever, I was exposed to many videos,
            messages, and stories about God online. These digital resources slowly helped me reflect on my beliefs and
            inspired me to open my heart again. Through watching, listening, and learning, I began to understand His
            presence and love in a way I had never experienced before. Over time, I gradually accepted God back into my
            life, and my faith began to grow stronger. Today, God is with me every day, guiding me, giving me strength,
            and helping me face challenges with hope and purpose. Technology played a key role in this journey, showing
            me that even in difficult times, I could reconnect with my faith and allow it to shape my daily life
            positively.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text3">For me, everyone should have integrity and live by it. Integrity means being honest,
            doing the right thing, and keeping your promises, even when it is difficult. I remember a time in school
            when I accidentally made a mistake on a group project. At first, I wanted to hide it because I was afraid of
            getting into trouble, but then I decided to be honest and told my teacher about it. From that experience, I
            learned that admitting mistakes and being truthful builds trust and shows responsibility, not only to others
            but also to yourself. Integrity also helps people respect you and creates a strong sense of self-worth. In
            the future, I will continue to practice integrity in all areas of my life, at school, at home, and with my
            friends, making sure that my actions always reflect my words and values. I want to grow into a person who
            can be trusted and counted on, and I know that living with integrity will help me achieve that.</div>

        <div class="text1">REFLECTION FOR RESPONSIBLE DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP</div>
        <div class="text2">➤ </div>
        <div class="text3">Being a responsible digital citizen means using technology in a safe, respectful, and
            thoughtful way. It is about understanding that my actions online can affect others and myself, and making
            choices that show care and responsibility. I remember a time when I noticed someone posting a hurtful
            comment on social media, and instead of ignoring it, I decided to report it and remind them to be kind. From
            that experience, I learned that using technology responsibly is not just about following rules, but also
            about showing respect and spreading positivity. In the future, I will continue to use social media, apps,
            and other digital tools carefully, thinking before I post, protecting my privacy, respecting others.
