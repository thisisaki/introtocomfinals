            Many things inspired me to finish my studies and strive to become successful in life, and these inspirations
            shape the goals I continue to pursue. One of my greatest motivations is the desire to become financially
            stable,
            because I want to live a life where I am no longer constantly worried about money or uncertain about my
            future.<br>
            Financial stability represents security, independence, and peace of mind, allowing me to focus on growth,
            responsibility, and giving back instead of daily financial stress. I want to be able to manage my needs
            confidently and plan for the future without fear or hesitation. At the same time, I am deeply inspired by my
            compassion for animals, especially stray cats that roam the streets without proper care, shelter, or safety.

            Witnessing their struggles motivates me to work harder so that one day I can regularly donate to pet
            shelters
            that are in need of support, supplies, and resources. I also dream of being able to provide permanent and
            loving
            homes for stray cats, giving them a safe place where they are protected, cared for, and valued. In addition
            to
            these goals, my family is a powerful source of inspiration in my journey. <br>They have supported me,
            believed in
            me, and made sacrifices to help me reach this stage in my life. Because of this, I want to give them a
            better
            and more comfortable life, help ease their burdens, and repay their efforts through my success. All of these
            inspirations push me to stay focused on my education, remain determined despite challenges, and continue
            working
            toward a future where I can live with purpose, help others, support my family, and make a positive impact on
            both people and animals.
