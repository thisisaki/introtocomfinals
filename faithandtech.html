    <h1>CONNECTING FAITH WITH TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text1">I connect my faith with technology in my daily life, and it has become an important part
            of how I learn and grow. My faith teaches me to be honest, responsible, patient, and kind, and I try to
            apply these values in everything I do. Technology allows me to study, communicate, and create projects, but
            I always remind myself to use it wisely and in ways that reflect my beliefs.</div>
        <div class="text2"> "Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through
            the word about Christ."<p>
            -Romans 10:17</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text2">"For we live by faith, not by sight."<p>-2 Corinthians 5:7</p></div>
        <div class="text1">During quarantine, I realized that technology could help me grow in my faith in ways I
            never
            expected. I watched videos, read posts, and listened to inspiring messages about God online, which slowly
            helped
            me understand Him better and accept Him into my life again. Even when I could not go to church or meet my
            family
            and friends, technology gave me a way to connect with God and feel His presence every day.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text1">I also use technology to share positivity and spiritual messages with others, and this
            has
            become a meaningful part of my life. I post encouraging words, share uplifting content, and try to inspire
            hope
            and kindness online. My faith reminds me to act with honesty, respect, and responsibility, even when I am
            using
            social media or other digital tools, so that I set a good example for others.</div>
        <div class="text2"> "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received
            it, and it will be yours."<p>-Mark 11:24 </p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text2">"Because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance."<p>-James 1:3</p></div>
        <div class="text1">Technology has shown me that I can use my skills and knowledge to make a positive
            difference
            in the world. I can learn new things, help others, and create projects that reflect my faith and values. By
            combining faith and technology, I hope to grow as a person, share hope with others, and inspire people to
            use
            technology responsibly and meaningfully.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text1">I have also learned that technology can be a way to stay motivated and focused on my
            goals
            while keeping my values in mind. Watching or reading positive messages online encourages me to work harder,
            study more, and improve myself every day. This shows me that technology is not only a tool for learning and
            communication but also a way to strengthen my faith and my character.</div>
        <div class="text2"> "And without faith, it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must
            believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."<p>-Hebrews 11:6</p></div>
